# Shopping Intent Classifier

## Overview

The Shopping Intent Classifier is a machine learning model built to predict whether a user browsing an online shopping website intends to make a purchase or not. By analyzing user data such as the number of pages visited, browsing time, shopping session timing, and web browser used, the classifier aims to provide insights into user behavior and assist in targeted content delivery.

## Problem Statement

With the vast amount of user data available on online shopping websites, it's essential to leverage machine learning techniques to predict user intent accurately. By understanding user behavior patterns, shopping websites can personalize content and offers to enhance user experience and increase conversion rates.

## Classifier Approach

The classifier utilizes a nearest-neighbor algorithm to predict user intent based on features extracted from user sessions. Key steps include:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Identifying relevant features such as number of pages visited, session duration, shopping session timing, and browser type.
3. **Model Training:** Training the nearest-neighbor classifier on labeled data to learn patterns in user behavior.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Measuring the classifier's performance using sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) metrics.
5. **Deployment:** Integrating the trained model into the online shopping website's backend for real-time prediction of user intent.

## Performance Metrics

Instead of relying solely on overall accuracy, the classifier's performance is evaluated based on sensitivity and specificity:
- **Sensitivity:** Proportion of users intending to make a purchase correctly identified.
- **Specificity:** Proportion of users not intending to make a purchase correctly identified.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore advanced machine learning algorithms to improve classification accuracy.
- Incorporate additional features such as user demographics and past purchase history for better prediction.
- Implement A/B testing to evaluate the impact of personalized content on user conversion rates.
